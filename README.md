# COVID-Mobiity

### Scraper to pull mobility data and stastics from Google's Covid 19 Community Mobilty reports found here: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/

### The reports are being released in PDF format, the script scrape.py outputs the data in designated .csv files


# EDIT Google has now posted all of their data available as a CSV file and so this is now unuseful and antiquated. The newly available data can be found here : https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv 

This small project gave me some good exposure to the following skills:
  - web sraping with Beautiful Soup
  - processing PDFs into text strings
  - parsing and indexing stings in systematic and defensive way
